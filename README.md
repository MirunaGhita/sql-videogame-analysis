## **Project Overview**

The goal of this analysis is to explore and visualize video game trends, including:

1. **Top Games, Genres, and Platforms per Region**  
   - Identify the best-selling games, most popular platforms, and top genres in North America, Europe, Japan, and globally.

2. **Decade-Wise Platform Leaders**  
   - Determine which platform dominated each decade (1980s–2020s) based on total global sales.

3. **Genre Mood Tracker**  
   - Categorize genres by “mood” (e.g., RPG = Adventurous, Simulation = Chill, Action = Intense).  
   - Track gamer mood trends by region and decade, revealing how preferences evolve over time.


## **Techniques & Features**

- SQL queries with aggregations (`SUM`, `ROUND`, `GROUP BY`, `TOP`) to rank sales data.  
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and window functions (`RANK() OVER`) for analyzing platform dominance by decade.  
- Conditional logic to assign moods to genres and analyze trends regionally and globally.  
- Provides actionable insights for game developers, marketers, and analysts.
